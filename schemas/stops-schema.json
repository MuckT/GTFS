When a stop has a parent station, the stop is considered to be in the timezone specified by the parent station's stop_timezone value. If the parent has no stop_timezone value, the stops that belong to that station are assumed to be in the timezone specified by agency_timezone, even if the stops have their own stop_timezone values. In other words, if a given stop has a parent_station value, any stop_timezone value specified for that stop must be ignored. Even if stop_timezone values are provided in stops.txt, the times in stop_times.txt should continue to be specified as time since midnight in the timezone specified by agency_timezone in agency.txt. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses.",
